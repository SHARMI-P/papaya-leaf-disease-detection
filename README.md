Deep Learning-based CNN model for classifying Papaya Leaf Diseases using TensorFlow and image processing techniques.
Papaya Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify papaya leaf diseases from images. 
The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras on a dataset containing 6 different classes of papaya leaf conditions.

The system can:
- Train a CNN model on leaf images
- Validate model performance
- Predict disease from a new uploaded image
- Save the trained model for future use

Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Classes:
- Bacterial_Blight
- Carica_Insect_Hole
- Curled_Yellow_Spot
- Yellow_Necrotic_Spots_Holes
- healthy_leaf
- pathogen_symptoms

Model Performance:
- Training Accuracy: ~60%
- Validation Accuracy: ~55-60%

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Deep Learning in agriculture for automated disease detection.
